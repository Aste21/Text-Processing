# Text-Processing
Program made for the university, file test.c is the one made by me.  


    Task description
Write the program which processes text read from the standard input stream and writes the processed
text to the standard output stream. The input text contains several lines, some of them can be empty.
The processing reverses the order of lines and words in every line. Neither maximum line length nor
maximum number of lines is defined, so fixed-size buffers are not acceptable.
For example, for the following input text:
William Shakespeare
Speech: To be, or not to be, that is the question
To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
(...)
the expected output text is:
(...)
fortune, outrageous of arrows and slings The
suffer to mind the in nobler ’tis Whether
question: the is that be, to not or be, To
question the is that be, to not or be, To Speech:
Shakespeare William
